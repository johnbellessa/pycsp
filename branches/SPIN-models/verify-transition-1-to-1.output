Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
    3.079	equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
    1.303	actual memory usage for states (compression: 42.31%)
         	state-vector as stored = 28 byte + 28 byte overhead
    4.000	memory used for hash table (-w19)
    0.458	memory used for DFS stack (-m10000)
    5.727	total actual memory usage
