Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
    0.083	equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
    1.170	actual memory usage for states (unsuccessful compression: 1416.06%)
         	state-vector as stored = 1445 byte + 28 byte overhead
    4.000	memory used for hash table (-w19)
    0.458	memory used for DFS stack (-m10000)
