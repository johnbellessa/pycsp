This is a PyCSP implementation based on the distributed channel model presented 
in the paper "Verification of a Dynamic Channel Model using the SPIN Model Checker".

It will use standard python modules only, to allow full compatibility with all
Python implementations.

See http://code.google.com/p/pycsp for new versions.
