0.2.3-0.3.0
-----------
* Alternative and Sequence now return a list with the return values from 
  the processes. 
* Added Spawn for starting background CSP processes. 
* Spawn() returns the started process
* Simplified version of pyrocomm. 
* Remote channels (network channels) can be used in ALT constructs, with some overhead. 
* BaseImpl.py has been renamed to CoreImpl.py
* plugNplay/IdProcess has been renamed to Identity
* setup.py has been added (for distutils). 
  python setup.py install should now work. 
* test code: 
  - network ALT test in test/net_t1.py and test/net_t2.py
  - added more poison checking


0.2.2-test - 0.2.3
------------------
* Applying patches from Robert Brewer, adding
  - Buffered channels
  - Timer
  - Mux2
  - Faster poison notification when using the channel as a Guard
  - Test code
* Iroduced ChannelEnd, and a ChannelInputEndGuard for use in ALT
* replaced the "empty" attribute of channels with a "_pending" attribute
  which should hopefully be less confusing. 
* Altered BufferedChannels to correspond more with newer non-buffered  
  channels. 
* Altered BufferedChannels to correspond more with the implementation of 
  the JCSP buffered channels. 
* Removed Psyco optimization. I don't trust it with the newer Python 
  versions (Psyco doesn't seem to be updated).  
* Adding Barrier
* Added @chan_poisoncheck to a number of channel methods to help 
  propagate poison faster. 

0.2.2 - 0.2.2-test
------------------
* new style classes instead of old-style classes
  type(foo) now returns foo.__classs__, simplifying some things
* Parallel and Sequence have been changed from classes to functions. 
* Processes are now created using the @process decorator, applying it to 
  process functions. This provides us with a clearer syntax for creating 
  processes: 
     Parallel(Process(foo, arg1, arg2, ...),
              ...)
  can now be written as: 
     Parallel(foo(arg1, arg2, ...),
              ...)
* Preliminary network support using Pyro (Python Remote Objects). 
  - Channel poisoning works across the network
  - ALT does _not_ work across the network
  - example/test code in test/net_t1.py and test/net_t2.py 
    (start the Pyro nameserver, then t1, then t2).
