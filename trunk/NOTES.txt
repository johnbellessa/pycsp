Fixed the remote exception problem in Pyro... to some extent. 
Needed to inherit from "Exception". 

Also allowed remote processess to poision a channel and channel end by
changing poisonChannel to a try/except block instead of checking the types 
directly (which wouldn't work with remote objects).

---------------------------

Using a simpler method of providing remote channels: I make a
RemoteChannel wrapper around the Pyro wrapper object. Since it is a
subclass of Channel, poisoning across the network works, and it should
also support poison propagation since the exception handler in Process
should now pick it up as a proper Channel object.

Alt will not work cleanly across the network though - we can't pass
the alt object across cleanly.
