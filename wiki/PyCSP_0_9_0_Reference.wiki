==<pre>Channel</pre>==
<pre>
Help on class Channel in module pycsp.parallel.channel:

class Channel(__builtin__.object)
 |  Channel(name=None, buffer=0, connect=None)
 |  
 |  Any-2-any channel for communication between both local and remote processes.
 |  
 |  To communicate on this channel, channel ends must be requested using the .reader/.writer methods.
 |  
 |  Usage:
 |    >>> A = Channel("A")
 |    >>> cout = A.writer()
 |    >>> cout("Hello World")
 |  
 |  A channel is registered at the Python interpreter level and hosted in the interpreter where it
 |  was created.
 |  
 |  Retrieving the address and name of a channel:
 |  >>> print(A.address)
 |  ('10.11.105.254', 33703)
 |  >>> print(A.name)
 |  A
 |  
 |  Channel(name=None, buffer=0, connect=None):
 |  name
 |    is a string used for identifying the Channel and must be unique for every Channel instance.
 |    The name is limited to maximum 32 characters. If name=None then a unique name is generated.
 |  buffer
 |    The channel may be buffered by configuring a buffer of size <buffer>.
 |    buffer=3 will create a channel which can contain three elements, before blocking send.
 |  connect
 |    If provided with (host, port), the channel will not create a host, but instead try to connect
 |    to (host, port) and register at the channel here.
 |    A name must be provided when connect is set.
 |  
 |  Public variables:
 |    Channel.address    (host, port) where the channel is hosted
 |    Channel.name       name to identify the hosted channel
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, name=None, buffer=0, connect=None)
 |      # Constructor
 |  
 |  __mul__(self, multiplier)
 |      # syntactic sugar: Channel() * N
 |  
 |  __neg__(self)
 |      # syntactic sugar: cout = -chan
 |  
 |  __pos__(self)
 |      # syntactic sugar: cin = +chan
 |  
 |  __rmul__(self, multiplier)
 |      # syntactic sugar: N * Channel()
 |  
 |  disconnect(self)
 |      Explicit close is only relevant for channel references
 |      connected to remote channels
 |      
 |      It can be used to make an early close, to allow another interpreter
 |      hosting the channel home, to quit. This is especially useful when
 |      used in a server - client setting, where the client has provied a 
 |      reply channel and desires to disconnect after having received the reply.
 |      
 |      The channel reference will automatically open and reconnect if it is used after a close.
 |  
 |  reader(self)
 |      Create and return a receiving end of the channel
 |      
 |      Returns:
 |        ChannelEndRead object
 |      
 |      Usage:
 |        >>> C = Channel()
 |        >>> cin = C.reader()
 |        >>> print( cin() ) # Read
 |  
 |  writer(self)
 |      Create and return a writing end of the channel
 |      
 |      Returns:
 |        ChannelEndWrite object
 |      
 |      Usage:
 |        >>> C = Channel()
 |        >>> cout = C.writer()
 |        >>> cout("Hello reader")
 |  
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Data descriptors defined here:

==<pre>ChannelEndRead</pre>==
<pre>
Help on instance of ChannelEndRead in module pycsp.parallel.channel:

class ChannelEndRead(ChannelEnd)
 |  The reading end of a channel. 
 |  
 |  Usage:
 |    >>> val = reading_end()
 |  
 |  Throws:
 |    ChannelPoisonException()
 |    ChannelRetireException()
 |  
 |  If the poison and retire exceptions are not caught explicitly they will automatically be
 |  propagated to all other known channelends provided to the process in the argument list.
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:

 |  __getstate__(self)
 |      Enables channel end mobility
 |  
 |  __setstate__(self, dict)
 |      Enables channel end mobility
 |  
 |  disconnect(self)
 |      Explicit close is only relevant for mobile channel ends to invoke an
 |      early close.
 |      
 |      The reason for an early close is to allow another interpreter
 |      hosting the channel home, to quit. This is especially useful when
 |      used in a server/client setting, where the client has provided a 
 |      reply channel and desires to disconnect after having received the reply.
 |      
 |      The mobile channel end reference will automatically open and reconnect if
 |      it is used after a close.

 |      Returns True for ChannelEndRead object
 |  
 |  isWriter(self)
 |      Returns True for ChannelEndWrite object
 |  
 |  poison(self)
 |      Poison channel end
 |      
 |      When a channel end is poisoned, the channel is set into a poisoned state where
 |      after all actions on the channel will invoke a ChannelPoisonException which
 |      is propagated through the PyCSP network to shutdown all processes unless
 |      caugth by the user with a try/except clause.
 |      
 |      Notice that poisoning may cause race conditions, when terminating multiple concurrent processes.
 |      See retire for an improved shutdown method.
 |  
 |  retire(self)
 |      Retire channel end
 |      
 |      When a channel end is retired, the channel is signaled that a channel end
 |      has now left the channel. When the set of all reading or writing channel ends is set
 |      to none, then the channel enters a retired state whereafter
 |      all actions on the channel will invoke a ChannelRetireException which
 |      is propagated through the PyCSP network to nicely shutdown all processes unless
 |      caugth by the user with a try/except clause.
 |      
 |      Retiring is an improved version of poisoning, which avoids the race condition issue
 |      when terminating multiple concurrent processes.

==<pre>ChannelConnectException</pre>==
<pre>
 ChannelConnectException(addr, msg)
    
    This exception is raised when a channel is unable to connect
    to the destination provided in the connect parameter.

    Usage:
      >>> try:
      ...     A = Channel('A', connect=('unknown', 999))
      ... except ChannelConnectException as e:
      ...     print("Addr %s is unavailable
", % (str(e.addr)))

    If a mobile channel end is sent to another remote interpreter, where
    the channel end is unable to reconnect with the channel host, then
    a ChannelConnectException is also raised.
    
</pre>
==<pre>ChannelBindException</pre>==
<pre>
 ChannelBindException(addr, msg)
    
    This exception is raised when PyCSP is unable to bind to a port.

    The host and port to bind to is ('', 0) which binds
    to 0.0.0.0 and any available port number, unless provided through
    environment variables, configuration variables or from parameters
    to multiprocess.

    Usage:
      >>> @multiprocess(port=99)
      ... def runner(chanName):
      ...     A = Channel(chanName)
      ...     cin = A.reader()
      ...     print(cin())

      >>> try:
      ...     Parallel(runner('A'))

</pre>
==<pre>ChannelLostException</pre>==
<pre>
 ChannelLostException(addr, msg)
    
    This exception is raised when PyCSP has a channel which is left
    in an unstable state caused by a broken network connection, which
    could not be reestablished.

    Usually PyCSP can not recover from this exception.

Help on function AltSelect in module pycsp.parallel.altselect:

AltSelect(*guards)
    AltSelect(G1, [G2, .. ,GN])
    
    AltSelect performs a choice from a list of guard objects and
    returns a tuple with the selected channel end and the read msg if
    there is one, otherwise None.
    
    Usage:
      >>> g,msg = AltSelect(InputGuard(cin1), InputGuard(cin2))
      >>> print("Message:%s" % (str(msg)))
    
    Returns:
      ChannelEnd, message    
    
    More detailed usage:
    
      AltSelect supports skip, timeout, input and output guards. Though,
      it is recommended to use the slightly slower PriSelect when using
      skip guards.
    
      >>> @choice 
      ... def callback(type, channel_input = None):
      ...    print type, channel_input

      >>> _ = AltSelect(g1, g2, g3)
      timeout None
    
    
      Note that AltSelect always performs the guard that was chosen,
      i.e. channel input or output is executed within the AltSelect so
      even the empty choice with an AltSelect or where
      the results are simply ignored, still performs the guarded input or
      output.

Help on function FairSelect in module pycsp.parallel.altselect:

FairSelect(*guards)
    FairSelect(G1, [G2, .. ,GN])
    
    FairSelect sorts the list of guards in order based on the history for
    the chosen guards in this FairSelect.
    
    Internally it invokes a priority select on the new order of guards.
    
    Timer and Skip guards are always given lowest priority.
    
    Usage:
