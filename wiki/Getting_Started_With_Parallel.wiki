= Introduction =

The pycsp.parallel module has a Channel type, which by default, allows other processes to connect to it.

There is currently no name server for channels, thus the location of channels must be known.

Every CPython interpreter importing PyCSP.parallel will listen on only one port, which handles all communication to channels and processes.

The default host is '0.0.0.0' and the default port is just any available port. To specify a host or port, the enviroment variables PYCSP_HOST or PYCSP_PORT may be used.

{{{
PYCSP_HOST=localhost PYCSP_PORT=8888 python test.py
}}}

The above cmd listens only on port 8888 on localhost.



= Limitations =

  * All channel names have been restricted to a length of 16 chars.


= Connection Handling =

As all CSP communications are using sockets, it may happen that sockets are disconnected unexpectedly. Such situations can be handled through catching the exceptions below.

|| SocketException || ... ||
|| SocketClosedException || ... ||
|| SocketConnectException || ... ||
|| SocketBindException || ... ||


Whenever a connection is lost, the connection is recreated and retried. If after N tries, the connection still fails, then...
